        <p>Community Healthcare Associates has a vision to preserve health care services and jobs in communities formerly served by defunct community hospitals.  Our innovative 'medial arts complex' model brings an array of medical services to one place â€“ allowing a patient the convenience to handle multiple medical procedures in one place.  This convenience allows for seamless health care services to the patient and increased cooperation from the various medical practitioners a person deals with.

        CHA sees an opportunity to remake how medical services are provided and the opportunity to preserve medical care centers in distressed properties and develop them into profitable medical services complexes.  The current model for community hospitals is not working as more and more of them close down due financial problems.  With our varied areas of expertise in business operations, healthcare services, and real estate development, CHA can maintain these vital medical complexes for communities around New Jersey. </p>
