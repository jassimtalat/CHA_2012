        <p><strong>HEALTHCARE SERVICES</strong><br />
CHA's principals bring the necessary combination of skills and experience to work directly with all of the key players in the redevelopment process. This includes concept design, permitting, construction and issuance of certificates of occupancy.  CHA helps practitioners to create optimal, custom-built office suites that provide patients with the best, cost-effective healthcare facilities available.

<p><strong>COMMUNITY STABILIZATION</strong><br />
Economically struggling healthcare facilities are often forced to close their doors to the public, often times after sitting vacant for extended periods of time.  Closed facilities lower surrounding property values and create opportunities for vandalism and blight.  The reestablishment of closed healthcare facilities as Medical Arts Complexes fuels the engine of economic development in communities at many levels - direct and indirect jobs are created, municipal tax revenues are generated, and needed health services are reintroduced.</p>
