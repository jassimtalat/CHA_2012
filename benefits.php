          Barnert Hospital and Medical Center is the best example of what CHA can accomplish.  CHA engineered a $22 million renovation of the defunct facility to turn it into a modern 21st century medical arts complex with a wide range of services and patient care facilities.  Under one roof, this facility houses a physician office, an imaging center, three ambulatory surgical centers, a pharmacy, a reference laboratory, physical therapy care, urgent care services, and several outpatient centers.  Additionally, Barnert has a 54-bed sub-acute care facility, 11 bed hospice center, and 125-bed residential substance abuse program.  All while saving 600 jobs in the Paterson community by remaking the model under which Barnert operated.  </p>
