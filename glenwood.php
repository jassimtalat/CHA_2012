         <p>Glenwood Village will include 224 residential apartments, 50,000 ft<sup>2</sup> of retail space, 10,000 ft<sup>2</sup> of fine dining, and a 439 space parking garage owned by the Bloomfield Parking Authority, all of which will be encompassed in a five-story building with the residential units located above the retail and restaurant storefronts. Because of the NJ Transit stop located directly adjacent to Glenwood Village, the property is designated "transit village" status for the community. This means increased investment in Bloomfield and an improved quality of life

With midtown direct service available right across the street, Bloomfield is going to become a relocation destination for commuters and young people going into Manhattan every day for work.  Glenwood Village is going to anchor that movement. This project is the first step in the revitalization of Bloomfield and its downtown.
